####Project Description####

This project is a deep learning-based binary image classification model that differentiates between images of dogs and cats. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras and utilizes data augmentation to improve generalization.
Dataset

The dataset consists of images of dogs and cats, organized into training and validation sets.

Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, width/height shifting, and horizontal flipping are applied to the training dataset to enhance model robustness.

#Model Architecture
The model is implemented using a sequential CNN structure with the following layers:
Convolutional Block 1: 32 filters, Batch Normalization, Swish Activation, Max Pooling
Convolutional Block 2: 64 filters, Batch Normalization, Swish Activation, Max Pooling
Convolutional Block 3: 128 filters, Batch Normalization, Swish Activation, Max Pooling
Convolutional Block 4: 256 filters, Batch Normalization, Swish Activation, Max Pooling
Global Average Pooling
Fully Connected Layers:
Dense (256 units, Swish Activation, Dropout 0.5)
Dense (128 units, Swish Activation, Dropout 0.5)
Output Layer: 1 unit with Sigmoid Activation

Total Parameters: 489,153
Trainable Parameters: 488,193

#Training Details
Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.0001)
Metrics: Accuracy

#Callbacks:
ReduceLROnPlateau (reduces learning rate when validation loss plateaus)
EarlyStopping (stops training if validation loss does not improve for 7 epochs)
Performance Monitoring
After training, model performance is visualized using accuracy and loss plots to analyze learning trends and detect possible overfitting.


#Future Improvements
Experiment with different architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.)
Hyperparameter tuning to further optimize model performance
Implement additional regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting
